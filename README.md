# Description:  
"Caps For All" is a data-driven initiative that addresses educational disparities in the United States. The project aligns with **Sustainability in Education** and supports the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**:  

### SDG 4: Quality Education  
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.  
- Focus on increasing enrollment rates for underserved age groups.  
- Address barriers to education for marginalized communities.  
- Enhance educational attainment by improving the quality of education delivered.  

### SDG 5: Gender Equality  
Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.  
- Analyze gender disparities in educational attainment across states.  
- Highlight areas where gender equity in education needs improvement.  
- Recommend policies to empower women and girls through equal education opportunities.  

### SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities  
Reduce inequality within and among countries, focusing on marginalized and disadvantaged populations.  
- Study disparities in educational attainment by race, gender, and disability status.  
- Identify high-performing states to replicate best practices in underperforming regions.  
- Develop recommendations to close the gap in education access and attainment.  

The project uses interactive visualizations with dropdown menus for insights and comparisons across educational factors such as age, race, gender, and disability.  

# Goals:  
1. **Analyze Enrollment Trends**: Understand the enrollment proportions across various age groups and identify areas requiring improvement.  
2. **Assess Disparities**: Investigate disparities in educational attainment across race, gender, and disability status.  
3. **Compare States**: Compare state-wise education enrollment and attainment to identify high and low-performing regions.  
4. **Provide Recommendations**: Develop actionable insights and strategies to address educational inequities and improve access and quality.  
5. **Support SDGs**: Contribute to achieving SDG 4, SDG 5, and SDG 10 through data-driven solutions and analysis.  

# Title of the Project: Caps For All  

# Key Files:  
- `QualityEducation.csv`: Core dataset used for analysis.  
- `Primary_Secondary_Education.png`: Visualization support file.  
- `Dataset_Description.pdf`: Metadata for understanding dataset columns and variables.  
- `Caps For All.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis.  
- Generated interactive HTML files: Explore trends and disparities through visualizations.

 # Pre-requisites:
 **Library Installation**:  
 - Install the following libraries before running the script:  
 ```bash
 pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly matplotlib seaborn category-encoders dmba
 pip install pandas numpy plotly ipython


# Script File:  
`Caps For All.ipynb`  
- The Jupyter Notebook script contains all the steps for data preparation, analysis, and visualization.  

# How to Use:  
1. **Prepare the Environment**:  
   - Ensure the dataset (`QualityEducation.csv`), image (`Primary_Secondary_Education.png`), and metadata file (`Dataset_Description.pdf`) are in the same directory as the script.  
   - Install the required libraries using the commands provided above.  

2. **Run the Script**:  
   - Open the `Caps For All.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Execute all cells sequentially to preprocess the data, analyze trends, and generate visualizations.  

3. **Explore Outputs**:  
   - The project generates interactive HTML visualizations with dropdown menus for comparing trends across educational dimensions like age, race, gender, and disability.  
   - Use these outputs to gain insights into state-wise and demographic-specific disparities in education.
