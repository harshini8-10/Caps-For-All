# Description:  
"Caps For All" is a data-driven initiative that addresses educational disparities in the United States. The project aligns with **Sustainability in Education** and supports the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**:  

### SDG 4: Quality Education  
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.  
- Focus on increasing enrollment rates for underserved age groups.  
- Address barriers to education for marginalized communities.  
- Enhance educational attainment by improving the quality of education delivered.  

### SDG 5: Gender Equality  
Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.  
- Analyze gender disparities in educational attainment across states.  
- Highlight areas where gender equity in education needs improvement.  
- Recommend policies to empower women and girls through equal education opportunities.  

### SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities  
Reduce inequality within and among countries, focusing on marginalized and disadvantaged populations.  
- Study disparities in educational attainment by race, gender, and disability status.  
- Identify high-performing states to replicate best practices in underperforming regions.  
- Develop recommendations to close the gap in education access and attainment.  

The project uses interactive visualizations with dropdown menus for insights and comparisons across educational factors such as age, race, gender, and disability.
